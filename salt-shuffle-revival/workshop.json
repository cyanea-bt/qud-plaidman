  "Description": "[h1]A collectible card game? In MY traditional roguelike??[/h1]\r\n\r\nYes! This is the revival of the premier [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1796067936]CCG minigame[/url] from the great mind of Nalathni. So unwrap your starter deck and jump into the newly revived collectible card game craze that's re-sweeping Qud! Everyone's playing it! (Seriously, Ctesiphus will still kick your butt at cards.)\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n[h3]Notes[/h3]\r\nThis mod is safe to install at any point in your run. If you uninstall the mod, you will get an error the next time you load your game, but the game will work perfectly fine and it will not error after that, however the cards in your inventory will be inert and will still not work even if you reinstall the mod. If you wish to see the source code for this mod, you can find it on my [url=https://github.com/plaidman/qud-mods]github page[/url].\r\n\r\n[h3]Thanks[/h3]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [b]Nalathni[/b] for the original code and game mechanics for this crazy cool mod.\r\n[*] [b]books[/b], [b]Sol[/b] and other helpful and patient modders in the discord.\r\n[*] Many other devs who have shared their code through their mods, which I have referenced while making this mod.\r\n[*] Of course the Qud devs for making a great game and opened it up to modding.\r\n[/list]",
